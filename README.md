Trepo - E-Commerce API
Overview
Trepo is a modern, scalable e-commerce backend API built with ASP.NET Core (.NET 8, C# 12). It provides robust endpoints for user management, product catalog, shopping cart, order processing, and role-based access control. The project is designed for maintainability, security, and extensibility, adhering to clean code principles and industry best practices. With the integration of a Services Layer and AutoMapper, it ensures clean separation of concerns and efficient data mapping between layers.
Whether you're building an online store or learning about API development, Trepo is a solid foundation to get you started!

Project Architecture
Trepo follows a layered architecture to ensure separation of concerns and maintainability:

API Layer:

Controllers handling HTTP requests and responses.
JWT Authentication and Authorization Policies.
Request/Response Models (DTOs).


Services Layer:

Contains business logic and orchestration of operations.
Acts as an intermediary between the API layer and the Core/Infrastructure layers.
Utilizes AutoMapper to map between DTOs and domain entities, reducing boilerplate code and ensuring clean data transformation.


Core Layer:

Business logic and domain entities.
Service interfaces defining contracts for the Services Layer.
Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for API communication.


Infrastructure Layer:

Entity Framework Core for database operations.
Repository Pattern for data access.
Database Context configuration.



AutoMapper Usage
AutoMapper is integrated into the Services Layer to streamline data mapping between DTOs and domain entities. This reduces manual mapping code, improves performance, and ensures consistency. For example:

Mapping ProductCreateDto to Product entity when creating a new product.
Mapping User entity to UserDto for secure data exposure in API responses.

AutoMapper configurations are defined in the projectâ€™s startup, ensuring all mappings are centralized and reusable.
